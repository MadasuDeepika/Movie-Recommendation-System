# Movie-Recommendation-System

A content-based movie recommendation system makes recommendations to users based on the attributes of movies that they have previously watched and enjoyed. The system analyzes the metadata and content features of movies to identify similarities and patterns, and then recommends movies that are similar to those that the user has already enjoyed.
